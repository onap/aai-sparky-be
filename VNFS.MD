# Sparky - Inventory UI Service

### _VNFs_ Overview

_VNFs_ is an aggregation based view that provides aggregate counts of VNFs based off of provsioning status and orchestration status.

### Navigation to _VNFs_

1. Main navigation menu
2. Selecting a search result related to an aggregation result (e.g. <orch-status> and <prov-status> VNFs)

### Using _VNFs_

_VNFs_ is driven by using the search bar at the top of the UI to find and select aggregation queries. Once selected, the aggregation queries will be sent to the _Sparky_ backend component for processing. When a result set has been determined _VNFs_ will render the data.
