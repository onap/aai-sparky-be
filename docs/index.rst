Overview
========
Sparky is a service that interacts with resources and traversal microservices, and provides users with a user interface to view and analyze AAI data. The main goal behind Sparky is to provide a clear and user friendly view of AAI data.

The key AAI repos for running the Sparky UI are:

- aai/sparky-fe: This holds the code that constructs the GUI
- aai/sparky-be: This holds the Java code and other technologies that provide the front-end with its data.
